### My Portfolio Page
## based on a custom WP theme, coded in PHP

This is my portfolio page. For this project I took my static site written in HTML, CSS and JS and converted it. The goal was to use WordPress' CMS to enter and update my favorite projects.
The PHP site then gets the data for the projects from the CMS and displays them including images and links.

No prebuild theme was used. I wrote the portfolio theme in PHP, SCSS and JS.
